# Xbox Messenger Automation Tool

An advanced messaging tool that automates the sending of messages using a database derived from the XUID (Xbox User ID). The XUID database can be sourced from our accompanying repository.

Due to API rate limits, it's recommended to have multiple tokens to enhance efficiency.
